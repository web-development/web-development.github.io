    <section class="a">A, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the Latin alphabet. It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives.[3] The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version is often written in one of two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ.</section>
    <section class="b">B, or b, is the second letter of the Latin alphabet. It represents the voiced bilabial stop in many languages, including English. In some other languages, it is used to represent other bilabial consonants. </section>
